//! The budget (R-BUDGET-1): what a session may spend, checked by the engine
//! before every model call it makes, so a runaway stops before the call
//! that would cross the limit rather than after it.
//!
//! What counts is what the provider metered — the `usage` of every
//! `response.completed` — never what a request asked for: a request's
//! `max_tokens` is a wish, and providers overshoot it (two qwen3.5-plus
//! calls sent with 1,200 completed 1,379 and 3,422). It is counted over
//! the session and every session descending from it by `parentSessionId`
//! (subagents, and theirs), on every branch of each log: spend on a branch
//! a rewind abandoned was still spent. `--max-tokens` counts generated
//! tokens — output and reasoning, the part a cap is meant to bound — and
//! `--max-usd` the whole cost, priced from models.dev at current rates the
//! way every krowk figure is. Both are the limits `krowk sessions budget`
//! takes, with its meaning: at the limit is inside it.
//!
//! The next call's cost is not known before it is made, so the check asks
//! what it costs at least. It resends at least the whole prompt of the call
//! before it on the same model — the log is append-only, so the
//! conversation only grows — and generates at least one token; priced as if
//! that prompt were all read from cache, the cheapest a provider charges
//! for input, that is a floor no real call comes in under. A call is
//! refused when what has been spent plus that floor would go past the
//! limit. A model with no price trips `--max-usd` outright: an unknown
//! spend is not a spend inside the limit.
//!
//! A backend makes its own model calls, so for one the host checks before
//! the turn starts and interrupts the turn as soon as a metered call has
//! gone over (`Budget::over`).
